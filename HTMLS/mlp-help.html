        <div>Ok, so let's be clear here first.
            The MLP class here is for implementing Multi Layer Perceptron. So if you are not familiar with the structure of these ANNs, check out the links bellow.</br>
            <a href="https://www.kindsonthegenius.com/blog/2018/01/basics-of-multilayer-perceptron-a-simple-explanation-of-multilayer-perceptron.html"> A short explanation </a></br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron"> Wikipedia Page</a> Though not really recommended to read it all </br>
            Plus if you are intersted in source of all the wisdom behind my knowledge (I wish) go read "Fundamentals of Computational Intelligence" by Keller, Liu and Fogel from page 35 to 57.</br>
            Ok, Now let's talk buissness. For any ANN to work, you need an Activation function which it's derivitive could be easily calculatable. There are obviously many choices.</br>
            From Gaussian function to sigmoid function and etc. So I leave this to you to decide. If you are happy to use the Sigmoid Function which is my favorite, feel free to use Sig-MLP class</br>
            else you need to override the function and it's dervitive as I'll explain.</br>
            Both the activation function and it's derivitive must accept an input and calculate an output. So it's 1D to 1D. Pretty simple.</br>
            If you had any other question, you are not allowed to email me at "Ark1375@hotmail.com". So that's it.</br>
            Good Luck
